                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="long-copy">Mustafa Nail Bülbül was born in Esslingen. In his childhood before he could even read or write, he
                    devoted his interest to building and creating different things. When his father bought a computer,
                    he started dealing with it. At high school, he attended the natural science subjects, where he
                    discovered his interest in programming. Because of that he began to teach himself programming with
                    small Java applications. Finally, together with three friends, he developed a little game that was
                    inspired by Mario Card.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to his interest in programming, he was enthusiastic about economy. As part of the JUNIOR
                    institute, he and his business course founded a company in which he was employed as the Deputy
                    Managing Director and the Head of Finance & Controlling. During his time in the high school he
                    realized that he wanted to study business informatics in order to reconcile his interests. Since he
                    likes to practice the things he is learning, only the dual study came into question.
                    <br><br>
                    In October 2017 consequently he began with his dual degree program at the Finanz Informatik
                    Solutions Plus GmbH in Fellbach. Currently he is in the sixth and last semester and is actively involved in
                    customer projects and is volunteering as the JAV chairman. He is active in various areas of the
                    company and is responsible for the design and optimization of processes, but also the development of
                    applications in various technologies.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to his studies, Mustafa is engaged in the development of iOS applications, ReactJS
                    applications and Java applications. In his spare time he likes to go out with his friends and
                    practice various sports. He also likes to read and spread his knowledge in different areas.</p>
